# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.




## [2.7.14] - 2026-06-03

### Bug Fixes

- **More reliable sync for imported models and VFX assets** — Project sync no longer stops with `Can't convert to JSON` when a Roblox model contains non-UTF8 string data in values or attributes. WEPPY now preserves that data safely and continues syncing the rest of the place.

### Stability

- **Clearer chunk-sync troubleshooting in Studio** — When sync encounters unusual data, WEPPY now points to the affected Studio object, field, and byte length in the plugin logs without exposing the raw value. Generic `Internal error` responses from the server also surface the detailed message when one is available, making support logs easier to share from the WEPPY UI.

## [2.7.13] - 2026-06-02

### Stability

- **Stability improvements** — WEPPY now tracks first-time MCP usage more reliably for operations reporting while keeping existing Studio workflows unchanged. No setup changes are required.

## [2.7.12] - 2026-05-28

### Features

- **More helpful Basic-plan alternatives for Pro requests** — When a Basic user asks an AI agent to use a Pro-only feature, WEPPY can now complete more of those requests with the closest available Basic behavior instead of stopping immediately. This helps common work continue across selection details, object browsing, Workspace summaries, property changes, simple multi-object edits, UI creation and editing, lighting/time/effect changes, and safe script lookup. Requests that truly require Pro still show the Pro guidance.

### Stability

- **Clearer repeated-request handling** — If the same request is sent twice, WEPPY now reports it as a repeated request instead of letting it look like Studio is taking too long to respond. This reduces confusing long waits and makes retry behavior easier to understand.
- **Clearer error reports** — Connection delays, Studio response timeouts, and repeated requests are now separated more clearly in WEPPY's error reporting, making support and troubleshooting more accurate without changing existing workflows.
- **More reliable Basic/Pro checks** — The validation flow for Pro behavior and Basic-plan alternatives is more stable, especially when testing a connected Studio session after switching between Pro and Basic.






## [2.7.11] - 2026-05-24

### Features

- **Polar checkout for WEPPY Roblox AI Toolkit Pro** — New Pro purchases now use Polar as the default checkout path. Existing Gumroad purchases continue to work without migration, and users who cancel Gumroad and subscribe again will be guided to the new Polar payment link.

### Bug Fixes

- **More reliable installer upgrades** — The one-line installers and packaged setup scripts now handle Codex configuration updates more safely, including repair installs where an older WEPPY MCP block already exists. Windows installs also avoid PowerShell shim resolution issues when locating optional CLI tools.

### Stability

- **License provider stability hardening** — WEPPY now treats the license provider as a generic backend detail instead of assuming Gumroad everywhere. This makes Pro status checks and dashboard license display more resilient while keeping current Gumroad licenses usable.
- **General reliability cleanup** — Internal dashboard, plugin, and release-package cleanup reduces stale artifacts and keeps setup guidance aligned across supported languages.

## [2.7.10] - 2026-05-21

### Features

- **Antigravity IDE and Antigravity CLI setup support** — The one-line installers and packaged setup scripts now recognize the newer Antigravity configuration layout, including Antigravity IDE and Antigravity CLI. Antigravity CLI users get a dedicated global MCP config path at `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/mcp_config.json`, while existing Antigravity and Antigravity IDE users continue to use their current config locations.

### Stability

- **More reliable MCP registration for Antigravity users** — Installers now check the current Antigravity config candidates separately, update existing files when present, and create the canonical `mcpServers` shape when needed. This reduces false "already configured" states and makes repair installs safer across macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## [2.7.9] - 2026-05-17

### Stability

- **Clearer failure diagnostics for AI tool calls** — WEPPY now records more precise low-cardinality diagnostics when Roblox Studio commands time out or fail inside workspace state sync and script editing. This helps support and future fixes identify whether failures came from queue delays, Studio connection state, script edit input, or a specific workspace sync stage, without exposing script source or raw Studio paths.
- **More resilient workspace state sync reporting** — Workspace state sync now labels failures by stage, so a problem while reading scripts, viewport metadata, tree data, or change history no longer collapses into a generic runtime error. Existing workflows and tool behavior are unchanged.

## [2.7.8] - 2026-05-16

### Features

- **French language support** — The WEPPY dashboard and Roblox Studio plugin now support French. Select **Français** from Settings to use the dashboard and plugin UI in French, and French systems are detected automatically when the language setting is set to Auto.

### Stability

- **More reliable localized setup guidance** — The dashboard What's New page now supports multiple localized setup links in a single announcement, so Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Codex App users can jump directly to the correct install guide for their language.
- **Language selector consistency** — The plugin Settings language dropdown now uses the same supported locale list as the localization runtime, so every shipped language appears as an option.

## [2.7.7] - 2026-05-14

### Bug Fixes

- **Codex Plugin Directory installation** — The Codex marketplace entry now uses the installable plugin metadata expected by Codex and appears as **WEPPY Roblox AI Toolkit**. The MCP server id and npm command stay unchanged, while Codex users can install the plugin and load the included WEPPY skills from Plugin Directory.

### Documentation

- **Clearer Claude Code and Codex setup names** — Install guides now use the same plugin id and display name across the public README, one-line installer guidance, and website docs, reducing confusion between the MCP server and the agent plugin.

## [2.7.6] - 2026-05-14

### Features

- **Skills for Claude Code and Codex** — The agent plugin distribution now ships ready-to-use skills for Claude Code and Codex CLI, so AI agents pick up Roblox-specific workflows (sync, game dev, UI) automatically when the plugin is installed. No extra setup needed beyond the standard install.

### Stability

- **Stricter validation for `batch_execute`** — Commands sent through `batch_execute` are now validated against each tool's schema before dispatch, so malformed batches fail fast with a clear error instead of partially executing.
- **Better error reporting for `execute_luau`** — Luau runtime failures now surface with structured classification (origin, recoverability) in tool history and dashboard logs, making it easier to diagnose why a script call failed.

## [2.7.5] - 2026-05-12

### Stability

- **Stability hardening** — Internal reliability improvements across the MCP server and Roblox Studio plugin. No behavior changes for existing workflows.

## [2.7.4] - 2026-05-10

### Stability

- **Stability hardening** — Internal reliability improvements across the MCP server and Roblox Studio plugin. No behavior changes for existing workflows.

## [2.7.3] - 2026-05-09

### Stability

- **Stability hardening** — Internal reliability improvements across the MCP server and Roblox Studio plugin. No behavior changes for existing workflows.

## [2.7.2] - 2026-05-06

### Stability

- **Stability hardening** — Internal reliability improvements across the MCP server and Roblox Studio plugin, including more robust instance resolution, unified metadata serialization, and structured error classification with clearer origin and recoverability information. No behavior changes for existing workflows.

### Improvements

- **Dashboard UI polish** — The dashboard has been refreshed with a consolidated semantic color system and refined analytics event tracking, giving a more consistent look-and-feel across pages and cleaner navigation context.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-05-05

### Improvements

- **Stability hardening** — Internal reliability improvements across the MCP server and Roblox Studio plugin. No behavior changes for existing workflows.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-05-05

### Features

- **UI Studio launch** — A new workflow for iterating on Roblox Studio UI design together with an AI agent. From the UI Studio page in the dashboard, you can now use:
  - **History tab** — Compare before/after snapshots and design suggestions for each request, side by side.
  - **Analysis tab** — Snapshot comparison modal with batch selection and deletion.
  - **Design Check** — Reviews your UI against design quality criteria and surfaces concrete improvements.

### Improvements

- **More accurate property types when syncing local edits back to Studio** — When you edit synced files locally and push the changes back to Studio, the server now resolves property types via class-aware metadata instead of guessing from value shape. Edits to enum, color, or vector properties on specific instances are no longer silently saved as the wrong type.

### Bug Fixes

- **Claude Code detection on Windows** — On Windows, Claude Code could be mis-detected and even a fresh install would fail with a confusing "already exists" error. Detection is now correct, and an existing valid registration is treated as success.

- **Dashboard tooltips no longer clipped** — Tooltips inside scrollable areas (Settings, UI Studio history) were being cut off. They now display in full regardless of the surrounding container.



## [2.6.4] - 2026-04-22

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix MCP server crashing on startup** — The MCP server could crash immediately on startup, preventing any tools from loading. The server now starts cleanly without any config change.


## [2.6.3] - 2026-04-21

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix MCP tools failing to register on Claude Code 2.0.21+ and other strict MCP clients** — Starting a session with `@weppy/roblox-mcp` configured returned a `400 input_schema does not support oneOf, allOf, or anyOf at the top level` error, causing **no WEPPY tools to load at all**. The server now sanitizes `tools/list` responses so the schema passes Anthropic API validation. Users on Claude Code 2.1.x were unaffected (the client already worked around the issue), but users on older Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, or direct API integrations will now get a clean tool registration without any config change.


## [2.6.2] - 2026-04-20

### Features

- **Help & Feedback in the dashboard sidebar** — A new Help & Feedback group has been added to the bottom of the dashboard sidebar, giving you one-click access to report a bug, request a feature, join the community, or open the official troubleshooting guide. The bug report link automatically prefills your OS, AI client, and MCP/plugin version in the GitHub issue form so filing a report takes seconds instead of minutes, and the troubleshooting link opens the official guide on weppyai.com in your current dashboard language.

### Stability

- **Improved overall stability** — General stability has been hardened for a smoother, more reliable experience.


## [2.6.1] - 2026-04-19

### Features

- **Dashboard design refresh** — The dashboard now has a cleaner layout with a slimmer top header, an updated sidebar using Lucide icons, and a new Upgrade widget. It also supports light and dark themes and follows your system preference by default.
- **Changelog shows before/after values** — The Changelog page now displays the previous value and the new value side by side for each property change, so you can see exactly what changed without digging through raw data. Added and removed items are highlighted more clearly too.
- **What's New announcement for the 2026-04-19 release** — The dashboard What's New page includes a new entry covering the design refresh, light/dark mode, and Changelog before/after display.


## [2.6.0] - 2026-04-15

### Features

- **Edit-mode screen capture** — AI agents can now capture the Studio viewport directly in Edit mode, so they can see what you see and give feedback on layout, lighting, and placement without entering Playtest.
- **German (Deutsch) language support** — The dashboard and plugin are now fully available in German. Switch to Deutsch from Settings → Language.

### Stability

- **Improved overall stability** — Tool execution, error messages, sync operations, and the dashboard "What's New" page have all been hardened for a smoother, more reliable experience.


## [Unreleased]

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

- **Legacy sync folder names removed from spec and runtime** — `roblox-project-sync` (the pre-rebrand folder name) is no longer recognized by the MCP server, dashboard, Explorer extension, or playtest/test-report writers. Users who still had sync data under `roblox-project-sync/` must manually rename the folder to `weppy-project-sync/`. The `wrox-project-sync` → `weppy-project-sync` one-shot copy migration remains in place as transitional compat code for users upgrading from v2.5.x but is no longer part of the spec and will be removed in a future release.








## [2.5.1] - 2026-04-12

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix installer failing when run from a directory with a local `@weppy/roblox-mcp` package** — If the install script was executed from a folder where `@weppy/roblox-mcp` was already present (for example inside the package itself or under a parent `node_modules`), `npx` could pick up the shadowed local copy instead of fetching the published release, causing setup to misbehave or fail. The installer now runs `npx` inside an isolated temporary working directory, so it always resolves and installs the latest published version regardless of where you run it from.


## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-12

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

- **Project sync folder renamed (`wrox-project-sync` → `weppy-project-sync`)** — As part of the `wrox` → `weppy` rebrand, the default project sync root and the app data directory have been renamed (`.wrox-data` → `.weppy-data`). Existing folders are **automatically copied** to the new location on first launch — no manual migration is required, and your synced files are preserved. The legacy folder is left in place with a `.weppy-legacy-path.json` marker so you can clean it up at your convenience.

### Features

- **Property Panel for VSCode Explorer** — A new dedicated property panel inside the WEPPY Explorer lets you inspect and edit Roblox instance properties directly from VSCode, without switching back to Studio. Open any instance and you get a Studio-style editor with grouped categories, dropdowns for enum properties, an expandable CFrame editor for position and orientation, per-property tooltips, and dedicated Tags and Attributes sections. Property values stay live with Studio, so edits in VSCode are reflected immediately and vice versa.

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix installer failing on Node.js 24** — Running the install script (`install.sh` / `install.ps1`) on Node.js 24 previously failed with module-type errors and never finished setup. The installer now works correctly across Node 18, 20, 22, and 24, so users on the latest Node.js can install WEPPY without downgrading.
- **Fix Property Panel appearing blank in the published Explorer extension** — The Property Panel rendered correctly in development but showed up blank when the WEPPY Explorer extension was installed from the VSCode Marketplace. The panel now displays properly in the published extension.


## [2.4.1] - 2026-04-10

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix playtest commands not working** — Resolved an issue where Play, Stop, Pause, and Resume commands in system_info tool failed due to inconsistent command string handling.


## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-10

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

- **Tool statistics and changelog history format updated** — The internal storage format for tool execution statistics (`tool-stats.json`) and changelog history has changed. Existing data will be automatically reset on first launch after upgrading. You will start with fresh statistics — previous history is not migrated.

### Features

- **Dashboard "What's New" page** — A new announcements page in the dashboard keeps you informed about important changes, breaking updates, and tips. Accessible via the bell icon in the sidebar, with unread indicators for new announcements.
- **Improved blocked-tool feedback** — When a Pro-only tool is used on Basic tier, the dashboard and plugin now show clearer outcome details (fallback, unsupported, failed) instead of generic error labels.
- **Connection stability improvements** — Added handshake timeout, connection cancel button, and license reconnect race condition fixes for more reliable Studio connections.

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix `ws` module not found on install** — Replaced dynamic `require("ws")` with a static import, resolving installation failures where the `ws` dependency could not be located by the bundler.


## [2.3.1] - 2026-04-07

### Features

- **WEPPY Sourcemap support** — Added sourcemap builder that generates and refreshes sourcemaps automatically after sync, enabling luau-lsp integration for WEPPY users
- **Dashboard improvements** — Added agent activity indicators, last-seen/last-command columns, process termination, and active place path display to the connection and sync dashboards

### Stability

- **Sourcemap generation hardened** — Fixed multiple edge cases around sourcemap refresh timing, redundant rebuilds, and state persistence to ensure reliable sourcemap output
- **Sync reliability improvements** — Improved sync history diff recording, collision index mapping, and error handling across sync and camera operations


## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-05

### Performance

- **Dramatically faster tool action execution** — Switched MCP ↔ Plugin communication from polling to streaming, eliminating round-trip latency and significantly improving response throughput

### Stability

- **Hardened connection management** — Streaming-based transport replaces polling with a real-time bidirectional channel, reducing dropped connections and improving reconnect resilience

### Bug Fixes

- **Prevent OOM on large history files** — Tool history and sync changelog reads now use reverse-chunk tail scanning instead of loading the full file into memory, preventing out-of-memory crashes on long-running sessions
- **Auto-trim history files** — History files are now automatically trimmed when they exceed 2 MB, keeping disk usage bounded without manual cleanup


## [2.2.2] - 2026-04-03

### Features

- add configurable MCP message polling interval and related options to plugin UI


## [2.2.1] - 2026-04-03

### Features

- implement command acknowledgment and in-flight request tracking to ensure reliable command delivery and timeout handling

- Add throttled sync initialization with retry logic and session cleanup
- Harden scanner lifecycle transitions: startup cancellation, resume, finalize, and queue ordering
- Close full-sync detector lifecycle races and preserve snapshot kind transitions
- Improve reverse sync path resolution with snapshot-based scanning

### Features

- Add client-mode idle watchdog with configurable timeout for automatic shutdown
- Separate health check and polling failure thresholds for better connection state management
- Add upstream permanent failure detection with graceful shutdown callback

### Bug Fixes

- Fix cancel-pending license state incorrectly treated as inactive
- Fix detector activity reporting and status exposure in idle responses


## [2.1.3] - 2026-03-31

### Stability Improvements

- Improve overall system stability and reliability

## [2.1.2] - 2026-03-31

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-29

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

- **Sync directory renamed**: `roblox-project-sync/` → `weppy-project-sync/`. All existing sync data will be stored under the new directory. The old `roblox-project-sync/` directory is no longer used.
- **App data directory renamed**: `~/.weppy-roblox-mcp` → `~/.weppy-data`. The old `~/.weppy-roblox-mcp` directory is no longer recognized.
- **Project sync resets from Studio**: After upgrading, project sync data is re-initialized from Studio as the source of truth. Any local-only changes not yet synced back to Studio will be lost — ensure your Studio state is up to date before upgrading.
- **License downgrade requires plugin action**: If your license changes from Pro to Basic, you **must** click "Refresh" in the plugin UI or deactivate and reactivate the plugin for the tier change to take effect. Without this step, the plugin may continue to report the previous tier.

### Features

- **Dashboard project root switching**: Added the ability to change the project root directory directly from the Dashboard overview page, with restart and path migration support.
- **Dashboard Place UI improvements**: Redesigned the Place summary display for better visual clarity and usability.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-03-24

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix install script failures on macOS/Linux**: Resolved a path resolution bug in `install.sh` that caused the installer to fail when the Claude or Cursor config directory did not exist yet. The script now creates the config directory automatically before writing the MCP entry.


## [2.0.2] - 2026-03-24

### Features

- **New one-line installation method**: Install the MCP server and Roblox Studio plugin with a single command. On macOS/Linux run `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hope1026/weppy-roblox-mcp/main/install.sh | bash`, on Windows run `irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hope1026/weppy-roblox-mcp/main/install.ps1 | iex`. The installer auto-detects the Claude/Cursor config path, injects the MCP entry, and opens the plugin install page in your browser.
- **Dashboard data clearing**: Added clear buttons to the web dashboard for connection history, tool execution history, and sync history. Each section can now be reset independently without restarting the server.
- **Plugin and MCP stability improvements**: Hardened the HTTP polling loop in the Roblox Studio plugin to recover from transient network errors without dropping the connection. The MCP server now retries failed result deliveries and surfaces timeout details in error responses for easier debugging.


## [2.0.1] - 2026-03-22

### Bug Fixes

- Fix setup scripts (`setup-mcp.sh`, `setup-mcp.bat`) failing to resolve MCP server path on Windows and macOS
- Fix project sync directory path resolution when multiple MCP instances share the same workspace


## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-22

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **ZIP users**: Package directory structure has changed. You must re-run `setup-mcp.sh` (or `setup-mcp.bat`). The MCP server path in `.mcp.json` has moved from `mcp-server/index.js` to `plugins/weppy-roblox-mcp/dist/index.js`.

### Highlights

- **Built-in Dashboard**: The MCP server now includes an embedded dashboard. Access it at `http://127.0.0.1:3002/dashboard` — no extra setup required for npm or ZIP installs.
- **Unified deploy structure**: npm, ZIP, and local dev environments all share the same `plugins/weppy-roblox-mcp/dist/index.js` runtime layout.
