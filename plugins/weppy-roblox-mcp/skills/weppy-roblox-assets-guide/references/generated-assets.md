# Generated Assets Reference

For AI-generated image files, save a supported local image first, then choose Studio-local or Open Cloud upload according to the requested owner and workflow.

For Roblox model generation:

1. Call `manage_assets.generate_model` with a prompt, schema mode, target parent, and review policy.
2. Treat the result as a Studio model path, not an Asset Library item or remote Roblox asset.
3. Run `manage_assets.review_model` when the model must be checked or registered locally.
4. Ask before any temporary embedded-resource upload or remote upload.
5. Verify the model path, bounds or review result, generated textures, and any returned Roblox asset IDs.

Do not invent image, mesh, texture, or model asset IDs.
